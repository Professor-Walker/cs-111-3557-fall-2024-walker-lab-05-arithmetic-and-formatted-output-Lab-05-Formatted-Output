# LAB 05 - Arithmetic & Formatted Output #

***Learning Objective: demonstrate arithmetic operations and formatted output to the console.***

For this lab you will be creating a program that converts a dollar amount to quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  The program should give preference to the higher-valued coins so that the total number of coins is as small as possible. Your program should include constants, variables, and be easily adjusted for different dollar amounts.

## Lab ToDo: ##

- Complete program documentation at the top.
- Create appropriate variables in "Declaration + Initialization" section of the `main` method to store data for the initial amount and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
- In the "Calculation" section of the `main` method, write statements that will perform the calculations to determine the number of each type of coin.
- In the "Output" section, write code that will output the results to the console using a formatted print statement. Following are examples of expected output.

```
$1.68 can be converted to 6 quarters, 1 dimes, 1 nickels, and 3 pennies.
```

```
$3.80 can be converted to 14 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickels, and 0 pennies.
```

- Ensure you are following all coding conventions and styles expected for this class.

## Submit ##

This lab does not have any built-in tests. To earn credit for this lab be sure that...
- There is a variable for the initial amount that can easily be located and changed.
- The number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies is calculated correctly for any non-negative initial amount. Test this yourself several times to make sure it is working.
- The output must use formatting to display the initial amount with two decimal places, and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies as whole numbers.
- Commit + Push when you are ready to submit.
